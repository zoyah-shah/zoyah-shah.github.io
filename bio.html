      <p>
        I am a rising junior at Parsons School of Design, and my major is
        communication design. I am from the Bay Area in California. Before this
        class I had done a little bit of HTML/CSS in high school, but I had
        forgotten much of this. This was my first time spending a lot of tine on
        it and learning Javascript as well.
